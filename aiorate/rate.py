    """
    Non-blocking loop frequency limiter.

    Notes
    -----
    This rate limiter is basically the same as in the one from pymanoid_. It is
    not as sophisticated as rospy.Rate_ but does the job with reliable
    repeatability.

    .. _pymanoid:
        https://github.com/stephane-caron/pymanoid/blob/d3e2098e40656943f2639f90a1ec4269cf730157/pymanoid/sim.py#L140

    .. _rospy.Rate:
        https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/noetic-devel/clients/rospy/src/rospy/timer.py

    The difference between a blocking clock and a rate limiter lies in the
    behavior when skipping cycles. A rate limiter does nothing if there is no
    time left, as the caller's rate does not need to be limited. On the
    contrary, a synchronous clock waits for the next tick, which is by
    definition in the future, so it always waits for a non-zero duration.

        Args:
            block_duration: the coroutine blocks the event loop for this
                duration (in seconds) before the next tick. It is non-blocking
                before that.

        The block duration helps trim period overshoots and brings the measured
        period much closer to the desired one (< 2% average error vs. 8-12%
        average error with a single asyncio.sleep). Empirically a block
        duration of 0.5 ms gives good behavior at 400 Hz or lower.
