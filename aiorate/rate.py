This module provides a non-blocking loop frequency regulator in the
:class:`Rate` class.

Note that there is a difference between a (non-blocking) rate limiter and a
(blocking) synchronous clock, which lies in the behavior when skipping cycles.
A rate limiter does nothing if there is no time left, as the caller's rate does
not need to be limited. On the contrary, a synchronous clock waits for the next
tick, which is by definition in the future, so it always waits for a non-zero
duration.

class Rate:

    """
    Loop frequency regulator.

    Calls to :func:`sleep` are non-blocking most of the time but become
    blocking close to the next clock tick to get more reliable loop
    frequencies.

    This rate limiter is in essence the same as in the one from pymanoid_. It
    relies on the event loop time never jumping backwards nor forwards, so that
    it does not handle such cases contrary to e.g. rospy.Rate_.

        This function is meant to be called once per loop cycle.

        Args:
            block_duration: the coroutine blocks the event loop for this
                duration (in seconds) before the next tick. It is non-blocking
                before that.

        Note:
            A call to this function will be non-blocking *except* for the last
            ``block_duration`` seconds of the limiter period.

        The block duration helps trim period overshoots and brings the measured
        period much closer to the desired one (< 2% average error vs. 8-12%
        average error with a single asyncio.sleep). Empirically a block
        duration of 0.5 ms gives good behavior at 400 Hz or lower.
